stops = [ "Croy", "Cumbernauld", "Falkirk High", "Linlithgow", "Livingston", "Haymarket" ]

#1. Add "Edinburgh Waverley" to the end of the array

#        stops.push("Edinburgh Waverley")

#2. Add "Glasgow Queen St" to the start of the array

#        stops.insert(0, "Glasgow Queen St")

#3. Add "Polmont" at the appropriate point (between "Falkirk High" and "Linlithgow")

#        stops.insert(3, "Polmont")

#4. Print out the index position of "Linlithgow"

#        p stops[5]

#5. Remove "Livingston" from the array using its name


#        stops.delete ("Livingston") 

#6. Delete "Cumbernauld" from the array by index

#        stops.delete_at(2)

#7. Print the number of stops there are in the array?

#        p stops.length


#8. Show as many ways as you can to return "Falkirk High" from the array?

#        p stops[3]
#        p stops.fetch(3)
        #p stops.index(3)


#9. Reverse the positions of the stops in the array

#        stops = [ "Croy", "Cumbernauld", "Falkirk High", "Linlithgow", "Livingston", "Haymarket" ].reverse


#10 Print out all the stops using a for loop


#        stop = 0
#        for stop in stops
#            p stop 
#        end

        # p stops
